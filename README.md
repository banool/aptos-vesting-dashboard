# Aptos Vesting Dashboard

The Aptos Vesting Dashboard has three main goals:
1. Show information about a vesting contract. If a specific shareholder (beneficiary) address is given, it will augment the output with information specific to that shareholder.
2. Allow users to easily and correctly interact with a vesting contract on chain, such as to unlock and distribute staking rewards.
3. Educate users about how the vesting / staking contracts work.
